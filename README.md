# Revature-P2-PokePost-FE

This is a recreation of a project I was a part of during Revature training. 
The original used primarily JavaScript, so I decided to reformat that to Angular. 
Additionally, I wanted to see if I could make the parts that my teammates made.
Essentially, this project is to hone in my coding skills.
